# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
# Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the price of a car. The price of a car is influenced by various factors such as the brand's reputation, car features, horsepower, mileage, and more. Car price prediction is a significant research area in machine learning and has practical applications in the automotive industry.

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a car based on its features. By leveraging historical car data and machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a predictive model that can assist car buyers, sellers, and manufacturers in estimating car prices.

# Model Selection
For car price prediction, Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor is used. The choice of algorithm depends on the complexity of the dataset and the desired prediction accuracy.

# Evaluation
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared score. Additionally, visualizations such as regression plot provide insights into the model's predictive performance.

# Conclusion
Random Forest Regressor was perfect! As less MSE and more  R2 Score comparatively.

# Future Work
Identify potential areas for further research and improvement, such as collecting more comprehensive datasets, exploring advanced machine learning techniques, and integrating external factors (e.g., economic indicators, market trends) into the prediction model.
